# D2Loader

[jaenster](https://github.com/jaenster)

A simple multi client, like the old D2Loader for 1.10 in the past.

- download [D2Loader1.14.exe](https://github.com/blizzhackers/d2tools/raw/master/d2loader/D2Loader1.14.exe)
- Move to your game folder
- Only alters client for a second by start up, and changes it back. Will seem unchanged for blizzard.
- Just put in your game folder, and make a shortcut to your desktop, add stuff like -w ;)
- Keep in mind by default, it starts without any option, so if you start normally it starts just fullscreen
